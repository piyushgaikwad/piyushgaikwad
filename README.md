### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am an aspiring software developer with 2+ years of experience as Back-End Developer.
Skilled in Python (Strong) , C++, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, MySQL, SQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With a track record of initiative and dependability, I have devised strategic initiatives which I believe will prove an asset.
I graduated in May 2021 and I'm interested in Full-Time Software Development role. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding my candidacy.
